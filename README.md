# Movies-ETL
Module 8

Objective

In this module I created a data extraction method using Python within jupyter notebook, performed transformations that organized and re-labeled data for continuity between datasets, and loaded the data into existing tables. Next, I created a function that uses three data files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data- and performed the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
